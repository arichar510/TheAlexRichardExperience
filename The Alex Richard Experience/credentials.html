			<li><a href="Resume - Alex Richard.pdf" target="_blank"><b><u>Resume</u></b></a>- Click here for a copy of the most recent version of my resume.  I mostly included this for any prospective employers or recruiters, but feel free to use this as a template for your own job pursuit.  The formatting comes from my college's professional development course for engineers, so it may not necessarily be suited to your specific needs, but I find it to be a pretty good format for general use and I hope that it helps you as you go along on your own job search.</li>
