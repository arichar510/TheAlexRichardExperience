				<ul>
					<li>I mostly made this site as a way to collate my bio, credentials, and all the pictures I take into one place without the hassle or grief that comes with social media, as well as demonstrate some proficiency with coding.  I intend to continue working on this site as a hobby, but I wanted to get the pics out as soon as possible (in very high demand lol), so please forgive any crudeness or simplicity of the site as it is still a work-in-progress.</li>
					<br>
					<li>The source code for the site is HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.  I wrote the code on a 2019 Macbook Pro in the Sublime Text text editor.</li>
					<br>
					<li>The pictures were taken on an iPhone 12 Pro.</li>
					<br>
					<li>The website is being hosted on "Amazon Web Services".</li>
					<br>
					<li>Not that the site is incredibly complex, but if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me on one of my listed contacts and I will try to get back to you. </li>
